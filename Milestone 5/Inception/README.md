*This project has been as part of the 42 curriculum by kagoh*

## Description
The goal of the project is to get the student to understand the basics of Docker, and its usage in systems administration. The project aims to have the student create 3 Docker images, one in nginx, one in Mariadb, and one in Wordpress, and have the 3 of them work in tandem to create a working wordpress site, complete with comments on a certain post, and being able to log in to a database as an admin to approve or delete comments.

## Instructions
When the evaluation starts, the evaluator should clone the repository in a folder of the student's choosing, with the command:
```
git clone <repository_url> [directory_name]
```
For starting up the docker and its containers, input the following command:
```
make
```
or 
```
make up
```
go to the following link:
```

All other relevant testing and evaluation should happen in the vm.

## Resources
The following resources were utilized in the course of this project:
1. Google
2. Youtube tutorials (Docker basics, containerization etc.)

### AI usage
AI was used as a learning and debugging aid in the development of this project.

Ways that AI was utilized:

- Minor formatting for markdown files, such as how to make code blocks, how to italicize text etc.
- General enquiries, such as "How do i test my nginx container to see if it's working?"

AI did not generate the entire project, but rather was used as an aid for understanding concepts that might not have been underestood immediately through Google search or Youtube tutorials.
